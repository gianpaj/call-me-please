# TODO

## To Fix

- fix iOS expo-notification sound
- test Android expo-notification sound
- fix nextjs landing page colours (light mode)

## To Implement

- should we use '@supabase/supabase-js' in the client side for auth? or next-auth? <https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/issues/1258>
- select language from a list of languages
- select an accent from a list
- show microphone level indicator when call is active (<https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-react-native/issues/183>)
  - show a circle that get's larger or smaller when AI's voice speaks

- keep call in background. something like `react-native-callkeep` but that works on Expo

## nice to have

- use `class-variance-authority` for Button component and similar
- Snooze button in the notification
