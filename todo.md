# TODO

- start webrtc python server using <https://github.com/livekit-examples/realtime-playground/blob/main/agent/main.py>
- deploy on Vercel or Fly.io


- should we use '@supabase/supabase-js' in the client side for auth? or next-auth?
- keep call in background. something like `react-native-callkeep` but that works on Expo

## nice to have

- use `class-variance-authority` for Button component and similar
