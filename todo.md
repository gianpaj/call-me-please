# TODO

- select voice from a list of voices using <https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet>
- deploy on Vercel or Fly.io
- show microphone level indicator when call is active
- show a circle that get's larger or smaller when AI's voice speaks

- should we use '@supabase/supabase-js' in the client side for auth? or next-auth?
- keep call in background. something like `react-native-callkeep` but that works on Expo

## nice to have

- use `class-variance-authority` for Button component and similar
