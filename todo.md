## App publishing

### Android

- design Feature graphic (1,024 px by 500 px)
- phone screenshots (2-8 phone screenshots. 9:16 aspect ratio, with each side between 320 px and 3,840 px)
- 7-inch tablet screenshots (same req. no min req.)
- 10-inch tablet screenshots (no min. 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratio, with each side between 1,080 px and 7,680 px)

## To Implement

- select language from a list of languages
- select an accent from a list
- show microphone level indicator when call is active (<https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-react-native/issues/183>)
  - show a circle that get's larger or smaller when AI's voice speaks

- keep call in background. something like `react-native-callkeep` but that works on Expo

## nice to have

- Snooze button in the notification
